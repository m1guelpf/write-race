## FAQ

**Why did you make this?**

I like playing with stuff :). While making [mirror-next](https://github.com/m1guelpf/mirror-next), I noticed there weren't any lists for Mirror publications, so I decided to make one, and play around with the $WRITE Race design in the process.

**I have another question**

Vote for me on the next [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) and I'll write a longer article about how I found their APIs and a few other cool things related to building this project.
